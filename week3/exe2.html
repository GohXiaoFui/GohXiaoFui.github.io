            I am 19 years old. I am from Kota Tinggi, Johor. I have got 3 brothers. I admire them and see them as
            an example to learn from because they teach me so much that I do not know and encourage me to try new
            things. Although we used to fight a lot when we were kids, they have become a great brother to me. I enjoy
            my current situation because I've achieved a balance between work and life. I hope to continue improving
            while staying true to myself.
        </p>

            Recently, I've started enjoying rock climbing, even though my motor skills aren't the best. It helps me
            enhance my fitness and reduce stress. I also love traveling because I enjoy nature and want to see more of
            the world. I enjoy exciting activities and hope to challenge myself even more to become a braver and more
            confident person who doesn't shy away from challenges.
